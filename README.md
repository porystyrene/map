this is a map viewer to measure distance i guess
<br>
<br>
i stole some code from [this guy](https://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/line-circle.php)
<br>
<br>
Left click to move
<br>
Scroll to zoom
<br>
Z to place points
<br>
P to delete nearest line segment
<br>
<br>
"image.png" is the map image
<br>
CONFIGURE SETTINGS IN "html.html" DIRECTLY
<br>
<br>
unfinished:
<br>
make nearest line segment get highlighted
<br>
add degrees conversion
