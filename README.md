this is a map viewer to measure distance i guess
<br>
<br>
i stole some code from [this guy](https://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/line-circle.php)
<br>
<br>
left click to move
<br>
scroll to zoom
<br>
z to place points
<br>
p to delete nearest line segment
<br>
<br>
"image.png" is the map image
<br>
configure settings in "script_initalize.js"
<br>
<br>
unfinished:
<br>
-make nearest line segment get highlighted
<br>
-add degrees conversion
<br>
-update conversion if needed
